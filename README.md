# Hasherator - Hackathon Project

https://hasherator.netlify.app

Project is meant to augment social media relevancy using Clarifai's image recognition API. Upload a photo directly to the website and the model will predict the most appropriate hashtags.

Upload an image from your computer or insert a URL of a .jpg file. On mobile, you can take a picture directly from your camera using the 'Choose File' button. This will generate relevant hashtags for your image.
